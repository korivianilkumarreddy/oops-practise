class and objects(with examples)
class has data/attributes and function/method
   code walkthrough
   attributes get called itself and methods are called manually
why python is called as OOPS  ?   every thing in python is an object(data structure, data type)
ADV of OOPS:
   you can create your own data type 
   code reusability
   debuggging
   easy to colab
